# Win8StartButton

A tiny executable you can pin to the Windows 8 Taskbar that looks like the old Start button but shows the new Start screen. It just makes up for the lack of a Start *button* on Windows 8 in case you don't have your hands on the keyboard and don't like the fiddly drag-mouse-into-corner-of-screen way of showing the Start screen.
